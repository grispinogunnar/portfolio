# Barbell Tracker

A Python desktop application for tracking barbells and analyzing squat depth in weightlifting videos.

## Features
- Real-time barbell tracking.
- Path visualization for the barbell.
- Intuitive GUI for video upload and analysis.

## TODO:

- Work around obscured views (e.g. squatting in a rack that partially obstructs the camera)
- Fix some GUI bugs
