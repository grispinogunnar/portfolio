## About Me

I am Gunnar Grispino, a senior computer science student at Northwest Missouri State university. I have a passion for learning and growing my skills, and thrive when it comes to developing elegant solutions to complex problems.

### Background

I am originally from Maryville, Missouri, where I am attending school for my B.S. in computer science. During my studies, I have dveloped a strong foundation in programming and problem solving, which I have been further honing with personal projects and self-directed learning. The huge variety in projects and classes in school have also provided me with the adaptability needed to learn and understand new concepts very efficiently.

### Experience

I have 4 years of programming experience through school and personal projects.
I am currently searching for an internship or future employment. I am eager to tackle a new challenge!

### Interests

In my free time, I will usually be weightlifting, cooking, gaming, or listening to a wide range of music.

### Get in Touch

I am very open to opportunities, collaborations, or friendly contact. Reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grispinogunnar)!
